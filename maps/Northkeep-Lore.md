# Northkeep

## The Last Bastion of the Northeastern Marches

Northkeep stands at the farthest reach of the Empire's northeastern frontier — a stone sentinel perched between the wilds and the waning light of imperial order. Once a proud stronghold built to hold the line against the Empire of Iuz, its walls have weathered decades of siege, frost, and neglect.

Constructed during the height of the border wars, Northkeep was part of a chain of fortifications meant to repel incursions from the Barrier Peaks and the dark forces beyond. Its towers bore the imperial sunburst, and its garrison swore oaths not just to defend, but to endure.

With the fall of Iuz and the shifting tides of imperial politics, Northkeep's strategic importance faded. The Empire turned its gaze inward, and the keep was left to the stewardship of minor officials and retired captains. Today, it serves less as a military bulwark and more as a haven — a place where travelers find shelter, merchants trade under watchful eyes, and common folk cling to the last vestiges of law.

But the north is restless. Banditry festers in the hills, and strange lights flicker in the peaks. The keep's walls still stand, and its watchmen still light the beacon — not for glory, but for survival.
